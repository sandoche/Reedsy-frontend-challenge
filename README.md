### 1. About you
I love to make side-projects, most of them are monetized through purchases or sometime ads. I invite you to check out my website (that I need to redesign): [https://www.sandoche.com](https://www.sandoche.com) or my [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/@sandochee).

I made 3 projects with VueJS ([Color Interactor - my first (badly written) project with VueJS -](https://colors.learn.uno/), [GitNews](https://git.news), Learners), 1 with Nuxt ([Undesign](https://undesign.learn.uno)) and 3 mobile apps with NativeScript VueJS ([GitNews](https://gitnews.learn.uno), [TextBlast](https://textblast.learn.uno), [WhatsBlast](https://whatsblast.learn.uno)).

As you can see one of them is not released, actually was my second VueJS project, it was a project intended to be a B2B solution for sharing skills social network inside for companies. The project was pretty big and complex, and even though we may never released it, it's the one that taught me how to use VueJS! 

My favourites projects are Undesign (very simple, but very useful), GitNews (web and mobile) which that I use everyday to discover new repos, and TextBlast which brings me the most money from all these projects! I particularly enjoyed building GitNews since I could re-use the core code of the mobile app to build the web version!
